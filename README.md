# Guide to files:
### 1. Analysis_Clean.r
This is the main work file where the analysis of the dataset was undertaken.

### 2. preprocessDataset.py
This is a small file that was used to remove the rows with missing data from the dataset, the output of this file is 'application_data_remove_na.csv' which is the dataset over which all the analyses of Analysis_Clean.r are done.
