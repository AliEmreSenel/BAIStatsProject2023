  author    = "Smith, Gary",
  abstract  = "BackgroundStepwise regression is a popular data-mining tool that
               uses statistical significance to select the explanatory
               variables to be used in a multiple-regression model.FindingsA
               fundamental problem with stepwise regression is that some real
               explanatory variables that have causal effects on the dependent
               variable may happen to not be statistically significant, while
               nuisance variables may be coincidentally significant. As a
               result, the model may fit the data well in-sample, but do poorly
               out-of-sample.ConclusionMany Big-Data researchers believe that,
               the larger the number of possible explanatory variables, the
               more useful is stepwise regression for selecting explanatory
               variables. The reality is that stepwise regression is less
               effective the larger the number of potential explanatory
               variables. Stepwise regression does not solve the Big-Data
               problem of too many explanatory variables. Big Data exacerbates
               the failings of stepwise regression.",

               is symmetric, then the Welch t-test might be used to compare

 abstract = {The field of statistics focuses on drawing conclusions from data by modeling and analyzing the data using probabilistic models. The authors of this introductory text describe three key concepts from statistics-estimators, tests, and confidence regions-which they demonstrate and apply in an extensive variety of examples and case studies. An entire chapter covers regression models, including linear regression and analysis of variance. This book, designed for students, assumes a basic knowledge of probability theory, calculus, and linear algebra.},
